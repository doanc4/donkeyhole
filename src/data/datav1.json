h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>
            Donkey Hole is about embracing the future while acknowledging our roots, and donkeys are the most important yet underappreciated animals in the history of humankind. The great Egyptian Pyramids, Rome, and even America as we know it were literally built on the backs of donkeys. So even though we are at the cusp of a technological revolution carried by blockchain and the metaverse, we must never forget how we got here. Carried by donkeys.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Buttholes?</h2>
          <p>
            Much like donkeys, buttholes are one of the most underappreciated pieces of human anatomy. Unless you're currently suffering from hemorrhoids, are anxious about an upcoming colonoscopy, or are a sexual deviant like us, you most likely don't spend much time thinking about buttholes on a daily basis. And even in the most adventurous of communitites, buttholes are often referred to as "the third best hole." But what we seem to forget is that without buttholes, as they say: we ain't shit. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, and perhaps most importantly, buttholes bring a smile to our face. Life is too short to be all serious all the time. Wherever you are on the planet, think back to your childhood. Before the stresses of adulthood took your joy away. And remember the feeling, oh how much fun it was to take ten fingers and rip open your cheeks to expose your youthful butthole to unsuspecting pedestrians from the window of a passing bus. After all, this is about remembering our roots.
          </p>

    "paragraphs": ["Sex toys for pets. Mood rings for the deceased. These are the types of idiotic business ideas we want to help create here at Dumb Ape Shark Tank. Pitch your idea, win, and bring it to life.",
      {"header": "What it is", "text": "Dumb Ape Shark Tank is like the popular show Shark Tank, except only for dumb ideas. We use NFTs to determine the participants and voting mechanisms. The dumbest idea wins a prize fund of ETH from the mint sales."},
      {"header": "How it works", "text": "Each Dumb Ape NFT is a ticket. Tickets are your chance to make it into the pitch competition. For those not pitching, they represent your voting rights. Your ticket is worth more or less depending on its attributes. For example, one Dumb Ape might be worth 10 points, while another Ape with rarer attributes might be worth 100. The total number of points you own across all your Apes will determine your probability of getting selected to pitch your idea, and how many votes you have."},
      {"header": "Prize Fund", "text": "40% of sales from NFT minting will be pooled into a prize fund. The winner of the pitch competition, the Ape with the dumbest idea, will receive the entire prize fund in ETH, and the opportunity to bring their idea to life in the real world."}]

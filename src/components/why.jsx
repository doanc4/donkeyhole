            The NFT space is full of projects that are all about status. Owners of those NFTs can flex their rare holdings for the world and metaverse to see. You will get no status from owning a Donkey Hole. If anything, you will look like a pariah to the world at large and many of your friends and family members may begin to distance themselves from you. Because who in their right mind would flex donkey buttholes? Verifiable idiots, that's who.

            We are starting with NFTs, but that's not all. From merch to events and billboards in major cities, we want more than anything for Donkey Buttholes to be plastered everywhere. We want people to see Donkey Holes when they least expect it, and be shocked, surprised, and baffled at how dumb the world is that we live in.

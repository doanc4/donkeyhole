            When the creators of Donkey Hole decided the time was right to create the dumbest thing that has ever existed, they each sat down and started sketching ideas. When they convened several minutes later to compare, they were shocked. They had both drawn nearly identical drawings. A bent over donkey, flashing his butthole.

            But in hindsight, this isn't shocking at all. It all makes sense. Donkeys are objectively a funny animal, and buttholes are objectively a funny piece of anatomy. And what is the point of creating the dumbest thing that has ever existed in the history of human civilization other than to have a fun time. This project is meant to bring us back to childhood, back before the stresses of the world took all our joy away. To back when the epitome of joy was the feeling of pulling our pants down, using 10 fingers to pry open our butt cheeks, and exposing our bright young hole to a group of unsuspecting pedestrians from the window of a passing bus.
